# ABC Company Employee Analysis Project

## Project Overview

In this project, I analyzed a dataset provided by the ABC Company, which includes information about employees. The dataset contains 458 rows and 9 columns, detailing various employee attributes such as age, team, position, salary, and more. The goal was to clean the data, analyze it, and present my findings in a report.

## Data Preprocessing Steps

1. **Fixing the Height Column:**  
   The "height" column had some missing or incorrect data, so I replaced those values with random numbers between 150 and 180.

2. **Checking the Data:**  
   I checked the dataset for any other issues like missing or incorrect data and made sure everything was consistent.

## Analysis Tasks

1. **Employee Distribution Across Teams:**  
   I calculated how many employees are in each team and found the percentage of employees in each team compared to the total number of employees.

2. **Segregating Employees Based on Position:**  
   I grouped employees by their job positions to see how many employees belong to each role.

3. **Identifying the Predominant Age Group:**  
   I identified the most common age group among employees by checking the distribution of ages.

4. **Highest Salary Expenditure:**  
   I found out which team and which position have the highest salary expenditure. This helps understand where most of the company's money is going in terms of employee salaries.

5. **Correlation Between Age and Salary:**  
   I checked if there is a relationship between age and salary using a graph to see if older employees earn more or less than younger employees.

## Insights Gained

- **Team Distribution:** I found which team has the most employees and which team has the least.
- **Age Group:** The most common age group among employees is around 25-30 years old.
- **Salary Insights:** Some positions (like senior roles) tend to have higher salary expenditures, while younger employees or entry-level positions have lower salaries.

## Visualization

For each analysis task, I created visualizations such as bar charts, pie charts, and scatter plots to make the findings easier to understand.
